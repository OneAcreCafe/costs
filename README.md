Costs
=====

My goal is to codify and publicise the operational data for a restaurant so it is able to interact with other systems.

Eventually this will be paired with a similar project for [managing a hostel](https://github.com/dhappy/housing) and a [coordinating program](https://github.com/dhappy/tour) that organizes housing and shifts for a working trip.

# Paid Development

I have bitcoins that I would be willing to trade for commits. Just [contact me](mailto:will@dhappy.org).

For a start, the following interfaces need to be added:

* *Order Entry*: Either the customer choosing menu items on their device or the server entering on a tablet.
* *Kitchen*: Touch screen or tablet with receipt printer. Ticket goes out with the meal to identify the destination.
* *Cashier*: Users can pay via a device, but there should also be the option of receiving a receipt and paying a cashier.
* *Costs*: Inventory and overhead tracking.
* *Suppliers*: Organizations providing ingredients.
* *Recipes*: I want prices to be computed from costs. Also I want users to be able to import caloric information from their receipt.
