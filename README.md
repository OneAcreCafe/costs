Costs
=====

My goal is to allow high level optimization of the economy by computer system. I want computers to figure out how much everything should cost so that everyone has a place to live and food to eat.

This can be accomplished by codifying the operational structure of an organization and then simply publishing it. A system could then aggregate information from multiple businesses and work on overarching effiency.

I don't know exactly what the system would look like, but it is a huge data problem that is not currently computer analyzed. The possible ramifications are innumerable.

I want to start with a restaurant. For version 0.2 I want to take in recipes and the costs of ingredients, and have the computer calculate prices for items.

I would like to pull the recipe information from Freebase, if possible.
