Costs
=====

This is a system to manage the costs for a restaurant.

The goal is for the operational process to be publicly available so that multiple businesses could be aggregated and the entire system analyzed.

The initial program will input:

* Costs for ingredients
* Recipes
* Expected number of meals per day

And will calculate prices then generate simulated data for purchases and sales.
