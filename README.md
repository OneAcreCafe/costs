Costs

My goal is to codify and publicise the operational data for a restaurant so it is able to interact with other systems.

Eventually this will be paired with a similar project for [managing a hostel](https://github.com/dhappy/housing) and a [coordinating program](https://github.com/dhappy/tour) that organizes housing and shifts for a working trip.

# Paid Development

I have bitcoins that I would be willing to trade for commits. Just [contact me](mailto:will@dhappy.org).
