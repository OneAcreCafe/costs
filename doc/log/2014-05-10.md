I'm just beginning this project and I find that keeping a development log helps me keep track of what I am doing.

At this point this software is just an idea. There's no organization willing to put it to use.

That's in large part because nothing exists. I want to create a simple demo that tries to compute prices and shows a graph of the status.

Computing prices means buying inventory and figuring out recipe costs.

To start with I just want a [graph of income and expenses](http://oneacrecafe.github.io/costs/step/d3_chart/). Show how they relate over time.

I'll not worry about the realism of the data for the moment. First I'll try to migrate the data to Ember.
